        <h2>What's the difference between var,let & const ?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Var :</strong>The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
            <strong>Let :</strong>The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
            <strong>Const :</strong>The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that canâ€™t be reassigned.

        <h2> Why we use template string?</h2>
        <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.</p>

        <h2> What's the difference between arrow function and regular function?</h2>
        <p>Since regular functions are constructible, they may be known as the usage of the brand new keyword. However, the arrow functions are simplest callable and now no longer constructible, i.e arrow functions can in no way be used as constructor functions. Hence, they are able to in no way be invoked with the brand new keyword.</p>
